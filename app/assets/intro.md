# New Ozfortress Website

This is an early prototype for a new [ozfortress.com](http://ozfortress.com)
(if the community wants it)
The goal is to redesign the website in a more modern style, while adding much
needed features. With match making in development I believe this is a much
needed change especially for new people in the scene.

My plan is to open source the website as a ruby on rails app, so that it can be
continually maintained/improved even if I leave the community.

----

New Features: (on top of what ozfortress.com already has)

* Login with steam*
* Bootstrap based styling*
* Fine grained permission system
* Markdown for forum styling** (this was written in markdown)
* Enforced SSL only (ideally powered by [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/))

*Already Working

**Partially Working, this was written in markdown

-----

Features to Consider:

* Automated, strict ban system
* Integration with current server reservation system
* Specially built league system (probably similar to razer arena)

----

I currently have a lot of time on my hands and am willing to put the work in to
get this working. But that can only happen with support from the community. If
this isn't something we can agree we want, then it won't happen.

To show off some of the current styling, I've copied some stuff off ozfortress
on there to make the page scrollable:

We are into week 3 of the Summer Cup 2016 main bracket, by the end of which only
8 teams will remain. We recognise that waiting for the next major ozfortress
competition is fairly boring and a major cause of stagnation for the competitive
tf2 community.

To address this, ozfortress will be hosting weekly tournaments on the Razer
Arena platform. They will begin this Sunday the 24th January and finish on
Sunday 14th Feburary, a week before the Summer Cup Grand Final. Summer Cup
survivors are still welcome to compete, but please ensure your game is scheduled
prior to signing up. Signups for the tournament will be available shortly.

TeamfortressTV has been producing highlights of top 6s clips from around the
world, and has put out a clip of Dreams sniping! It's taken from
Labracadabradors vs. U bad lol? on Process. Keep an eye out for more Summer Cup
highlights with top #productionvalue from the likes of truktruk, dashner and
more!

Backcap continues to produce high quality competitive TF2 content, targeted at
both the competitive and pub community. If you've missed the last few episodes,
make sure you check out sIN's channel. The latest video includes highlights from
Labracadabradors vs. U bad lol? Keep an eye out for this weeks video which
should include some awesome highlights, particularly from U bad lol? vs. Great
Gravy on Gullywash.

As always, high level casted games will be events on TeamfortressTV and able to
be bet on at Saloon.tf. Speaking of casted games, TFLIVE is casting Male Cougars
vs. SACRED.tf TONIGHT! Click here for the details. If you've missed any of the
recent casted games, VODs will be available on the TFLIVE Youtube shortly after
the match.

Don't forget to check out the ozfortress Discord if you haven't already. It's
the official method of contacting admins but also a great place to hang out.
TeamfortressTV and other communities also have Discord channels which you can
join and chat. Finally, the ozfortress Twitter provides updates about
tournaments and when casted games are going live.

Enjoy your TF2-filled Summer!

ozfortress is now hosting an official discord for communications. This is now
the number one way to contact admins and a great community hub for everyone to
hang out and organize in.

This is now the official way to contact admins. Some may not be contactable via
steam.

We've created a few channels like #scrims and #mercs, but we have a few private
channels for team captains and the like. If you're a summer cup captain, find an
online admin and request access to #sc16_captains. Find admins in #help.

Click the discord icon below to join. We recommend using the desktop app, and
there's an excellent mobile app as well.

We hope you all have a lovely and Merry Christmas this holiday season. We've
enjoyed a great 2015 and can't wait till 2016 for new seasons, new tournaments,
and a new outlook on the game of TF2.

Valve has given us a great Christmas present with the brand new matchmaking
feature, which will certainly breath some life into this game! We look forward
to the influx of new players into the scene and hope you will welcome them with
open arms, with the true spirit of Christmas.

This year has been an awesome one at ozfortress, with the introduction of one
night events, some awesome (and probably last, stay tuned) ozfortress winter
leagues, the most viewed ozfortress event ever on Tip of the Hats, and the kick
off to the first long form ozfortress summer cup.

We hope you enjoyed 2015 as much as we did, but we're also looking towards a
great 2016. Of course, SC16 will be in full swing right away, starting January
3rd. Our next seasonal competition, whether it's owl or something fresh, will be
starting around early-mid March, so make sure your teams are all hyped up and
ready for that. Leading up to that, we will be running some more small cups on
razer arena as teams start to get eliminated from the summer cup and need stuff
to do. Can't wait to see you there for all the fun bits and bobs we have coming
up.

Thanks everyone for traveling with us throughout the year and being such a
supportive community. We do this because we love it, and we hope you love the
ride too.

From the ozfortress team: madjack, shrak, brodogs, tonberry, rhk, bladez,
geomanis, wm, ferelah, lammy, ryno, tom sawyer, kenneth, merk, and the ghosts of
admins past.
