Premier and Intermediate will have eight teams while Main and Open will have an unrestricted number of teams.</span></p><p><span>The regular season will be played over 7 weeks, with finals rounds lasting approximately 3 weeks. It is a team’s responsibility to commit to the full length of the season when they submit an application.</span></p><p><span>Two maps will be played for each regular season match. Matches are expected to last just over an hour.</span></p><h3 id="Premier-and-Intermediate" data-id="Premier-and-Intermediate"><span>Premier and Intermediate</span></h3><p><span>The regular season will be run on a Round Robin system, where each team plays each other once.</span></p><h3 id="Main-and-Open" data-id="Main-and-Open"><span>Main and Open</span></h3><p><span>The regular season will be run on a Swiss system, where each round is seeded based on the previous records of teams.</span></p><p><span>See </span><a href="#14-swiss-system"><span>Rule 1.4</span></a><span> for further details on the Swiss system.</span></p><h2 id="12-Playoffs-Format" data-id="12-Playoffs-Format"><span>1.2 Playoffs Format</span></h2><p><span>At the conclusion of the regular season, the top four placing teams of each bracket advance to playoffs.</span></p><p><span>Playoffs matches will each be a best of three (BO3) with the exception of the Premier Grand Final, which will be a best of five (BO5).</span></p><h3 id="Page-Playoffs" data-id="Page-Playoffs"><span>Page Playoffs</span></h3><p><span>Playoffs for all brackets will be played using the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_playoff_system" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>page playoff system</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>In the Upper Page Playoff, the first and second placed teams will play against each other. The winner advances directly to the Grand Final.</span></p><p><span>In the Lower Page Playoff, the third and fourth placed teams will play against each other. The loser is eliminated.</span></p><p><span>The loser of the Upper Page Playoff will compete with the winner of the Lower Page Playoff in the Semi-Final. The loser of the Semi-Final will receive Third Place and the winner will advance to the Grand Final. There is no Bronze Match.</span></p><p><span>Open and Intermediate Grand Finals will be played as a best of 3, the Premier Grand Final will be played as a best of 5.</span></p><h2 id="13-Fixtures" data-id="13-Fixtures"><span>1.3 Fixtures</span></h2><p><span>Regular season match fixtures will be posted week to week after each round has been finalised. Fixtures are set at weekly intervals to be played between Sunday and Thursday.</span></p><p><span>Match pages will be posted on the Friday prior to that round’s fixtures.</span></p><h2 id="14-Swiss-System" data-id="14-Swiss-System"><span>1.4 Swiss System</span></h2><p><span>The Swiss system allows many competitors to compete against each other in a relatively small number of rounds. The first round will be scheduled randomly, and each subsequent round will be generated based on the previous results of teams. Teams with the same or similar records will be paired against each other, with the likelihood of duplicate matches is minimised.</span></p><h2 id="15-Match-Scoring" data-id="15-Match-Scoring"><span>1.5 Match Scoring</span></h2><p><span>Each match consists of two maps; the winner of each individual map will be awarded two league points, while the loser is awarded zero. In the event of a map draw, see </span><a href="#17-draws"><span>Rule 1.7</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Rankings will first be determined by these match points. If point draws exist, the following methods will be used to break them:</span></p><p><strong><span>Premier</span></strong></p><ol>
<li><span>Match wins vs. Tied participants.</span></li>
<li><span>Total match wins.</span></li>
<li><span>Win difference (Total points scored vs. total points lost).</span></li>
</ol><p><strong><span>Intermediate and Open</span></strong></p><ol>
<li><span>Match wins vs. Tied participants.</span></li>
<li><span>Median-Buchholz score (total).</span></li>
<li><span>Win difference (Total points earned minus total points lost).</span></li>
</ol><h2 id="16-Forfeits" data-id="16-Forfeits"><span>1.6 Forfeits</span></h2><p><span>A maximum of one forfeit per team is permitted in ozfortress competitions, on the second forfeit a team is considered inactive and removed from the league. Exclusion penalties will then apply for future ozfortress participation. See </span><a href="#25-disbanded-or-removed-teams"><span>Rule 2.5</span></a><span> for more information on disbanded and removed teams.</span></p><p><span>Forfeiting a single map will result in the entire fixture being forfeited.</span></p><p><span>It is the team captain’s responsibility to contact your bracket’s Administrator as soon as possible if there is a change in circumstances that will affect your team’s ability to field a team each round, even if it is a temporary problem.</span></p><p><strong><span>ANY forfeit in finals rounds will result in a removal from the league and additional sanctions on the offending team.</span></strong></p><h3 id="Forfeit-Types" data-id="Forfeit-Types"><span>Forfeit Types</span></h3><h4 id="Forfeit-Win" data-id="Forfeit-Win"><span>Forfeit Win</span></h4><p><span>A forfeit win will be awarded where the offending team has not made an effort to organise the match. Forfeit wins will also be considered as a punitive measure where serious rule breaches have been committed during a match. A forfeit win will be recorded as match win worth 4 league points. See </span><a href="#46-submitting-forfeit-wins"><span>Rule 4.6</span></a><span> on how to submit a forfeit win.</span></p><h4 id="Mutual-Forfeit" data-id="Mutual-Forfeit"><span>Mutual Forfeit</span></h4><p><span>Mutual forfeits will be applied where neither team have made an effort to organise the match within a reasonable timeframe. A mutual forfeit will be recorded as a match loss for both teams, worth 0 league points.</span></p><p><span>Mutual forfeits contribute to the 2-forfeit league removal count.</span></p><h4 id="Technical-Forfeit" data-id="Technical-Forfeit"><span>Technical Forfeit</span></h4><p><span>A technical forfeit will be awarded in cases where situations outside the teams’ control occur, preventing both teams from playing the match, including but not limited to, Steam outages or major weather events. A technical forfeit will be recorded as a match draw, worth 2 league points for each team.</span></p><h2 id="17-Draws" data-id="17-Draws"><span>1.7 Draws</span></h2><p><span>Draws on individual maps are not possible in the ozfortress ruleset, as the map will be determined by a Golden Cap, however matches can result in a draw when each team wins one map.</span></p><h2 id="18-Administrators" data-id="18-Administrators"><span>1.8 Administrators</span></h2><p><span>Administrators are responsible for the efficient running of ozfortress competitions. Each bracket will be assigned administrators who will be the first point of contact for support and any disputes. However, all league administrators can assist or deliver rulings on disputes if your bracket administrator is not available.</span></p><p><span>The League Coordinator is ultimately responsible for the general running of the league.</span></p><h2 id="19-Foreign-Teams-and-Players" data-id="19-Foreign-Teams-and-Players"><span>1.9 Foreign Teams and Players</span></h2><p><span>ozfortress primarily caters players from Australia and New Zealand, however players from other areas such as Asia are welcome to compete. Foreign teams must still play on ozfortress servers, unless it is determined that using an alternative server is beneficial for both the native and foreign teams. For example, in a match between teams from Singapore and Western Australia may choose to use an approved server located in Perth.</span></p><h2 id="110-Sportsmanship" data-id="110-Sportsmanship"><span>1.10 Sportsmanship</span></h2><p><span>Teams participating are required to conduct themselves in a sportsmanlike manner in all communications.</span></p><p><span>Global chat is not fully restricted and may be used for light, friendly and tasteful banter. However, at the request of either team captain or an ozfortress administrator, chat may be restricted to only essential match communication. This request must be clearly stated in global chat or the match thread.</span></p><p><span>Discrimination on the basis of, but not limited to, race, nationality, religious beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, or age will be regarded as an extreme breach of sportsmanship.</span></p><p><span>Breach of the sportsmanship clause may result in exclusion penalties to be determined by the ozfortress administration.</span></p><h1 id="2-Teams" data-id="2-Teams"><span>2 Teams</span></h1><h2 id="21-Application" data-id="21-Application"><span>2.1 Application</span></h2><p><span>Teams apply preseason to enter the league and nominate their desired bracket. A minimum of six eligible players are required for the application to be processed, however we recommend that teams have a minimum of two backups on their roster. It is expected that your team is available to play at least three days out of the five eligible days.</span></p><p><span>Roster sizes are capped at ten.</span></p><p><span>Players who have played in the Premier bracket shall be reviewed by administrators prior to transfer or placement in an Open or Intermediate team. These players may be class restricted if they wish to play in the Open or Intermediate brackets.</span></p><h2 id="22-Player-Eligibility" data-id="22-Player-Eligibility"><span>2.2 Player Eligibility</span></h2><p><strong><span>To be eligible to be accepted onto a team’s roster, a player must:</span></strong></p><ul>
<li><span>Have an ozfortress Citadel account.</span></li>
<li><span>Not be under any current competition exclusion penalties.</span></li>
</ul><h2 id="23-Captains" data-id="23-Captains"><span>2.3 Captains</span></h2><p><span>A team must nominate a player(s) to act as a captain to represent the team in organizing matches and liaising with ozfortress administrators. This player(s) has the ultimate responsibility for their team. Match communication is expected to be clear and concise. Individuals or teams who complicate the organisation of matches, or post irrelevant content will receive captaincy bans. Captains may be excluded from acting as team captain for future competitions if ozfortress administrators consider them to be unfit to lead.</span></p><h2 id="24-Mutiny-Rule" data-id="24-Mutiny-Rule"><span>2.4 Mutiny Rule</span></h2><p><span>A simple majority of registered team members may elect to nominate a new captain, or remove the captain entirely, at any point of the season with the approval of the league coordinator. This may be used when a captain is the sole reason for an imminent disband of a team. In this situation, the team at large will remain without penalty.</span></p><h2 id="25-Disbanded-or-Removed-Teams" data-id="25-Disbanded-or-Removed-Teams"><span>2.5 Disbanded or Removed Teams</span></h2><p><span>The captain of a disbanded or removed team will receive a tier two infraction. Administrators will subject future applications from a disbanded or removed team to a closer review. In some instances, players may be banned from captaining teams in the future.</span></p><p><span>To avoid penalty, captains and/or team members should approach League Administrators at the first sign of trouble to determine a solution.</span></p><p><span>In the event of a disband that the admin team believes was preventable and/or unnecessary, additional restrictions may be placed on the members of the team. This may include but is not limited to: Inability to play out the remainder of the season on a different roster or captaincy bans for specific individuals.</span></p><h2 id="26-Transfers" data-id="26-Transfers"><span>2.6 Transfers</span></h2><p><span>Teams may transfer in players on a weekly basis. The transfer application must be submitted by the match deadline of a round to be eligible for play in the following round. View how to apply for a transfer </span><a href="https://warzone.ozfortress.com/transfers" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>Teams will only be able to increase the size of their roster throughout the season to the roster limit of ten players. Teams with ten players or more may not increase their roster size through transfers unless enough players have been transferred out of their team to put their roster size under the limit.</span></p><p><span>Weeks 6 is the final week for transfers. Administrators reserve the right to deny transfer applications. Transfers will be approved by administrators no later than Saturday at 11:59 PM.</span></p><h2 id="27-Infractions-Warnings-and-Exclusions" data-id="27-Infractions-Warnings-and-Exclusions"><span>2.7 Infractions, Warnings, and Exclusions</span></h2><p><span>In each competition, administrators will keep track of rule breaches. Warnings and Infractions will be posted on the match and roster pages.</span></p><p><span>There is no specific number of infractions or warnings to determine if a team is to be excluded from a competition; the judgement by the discretion of the administrators.</span></p><p><span>Exclusions will be applied for repeated major rule breaches by a player or team. An exclusion will result in the immediate ejection of the player or team from the league, with potential prohibitions from playing in future competitions. In serious cases, exclusions may apply for first offenses.</span></p><h1 id="3-Match-Organisation" data-id="3-Match-Organisation"><span>3 Match Organisation</span></h1><h2 id="31-Negotiating-Match-Times" data-id="31-Negotiating-Match-Times"><span>3.1 Negotiating Match Times</span></h2><p><span>Each team must select a minimum of three days in which they are able to play. Captains may change your team’s availability from a week to week basis from Thursday 4:00PM to Saturday 8:00PM. Once the match for the round has been posted, teams can begin negotiating to arrange a time and date for their match. If a match time has not been negotiated between the teams, the earliest matching day from both team’s selections will be appointed as the default date. However, this default date can be changed under agreement of both teams.</span></p><p><span>In addition to official match days, there are also official match times. These times are 8 &amp; 9 PM Melbourne/Sydney time (AEST/AEDT). Teams that can make these time will be looked upon more favourably than teams who can not.</span></p><p><span>It is expected that team captains or a nominated team member make a reasonable effort to organise their match before the organisation deadline. Team members who facetiously propose match times will be punished.</span></p><p><span>Communications in match threads are considered the authoritative log for all correspondence about match organisation. Teams may decide to (and are encouraged to) negotiate the match over Steam chat or other means, however we recommend posting chat logs in the thread to prove that such correspondence has taken place in case of a dispute.</span></p><p><span>The negotiated time must always be posted in the thread.</span></p><p><span>If it is proving difficult to get in contact with the other team, or they are not making a reasonable effort to organise the match, please bring it to the attention of your bracket’s League Administrator immediately.</span></p><p><span>Teams may request an extension for a playoff match through their bracket’s League Administrator. If an extension is granted, both teams must agree on a date within the allocated time. Opposing teams are not obligated to play within the extended period although compromise and sportsmanship between teams is encouraged.</span></p><h2 id="32-Match-Deadlines" data-id="32-Match-Deadlines"><span>3.2 Match Deadlines</span></h2><p><strong><span>Match time set:</span></strong><span> 7:00PM Sunday</span></p><p><strong><span>Results submission:</span></strong><span> 11:59PM Thursday</span></p><h2 id="33-Organisational-Responsibilities" data-id="33-Organisational-Responsibilities"><span>3.3 Organisational Responsibilities</span></h2><p><span>The responsibility for these tasks falls upon the team captain of each team. If he is unable to complete these tasks or ensure these tasks are completed, he must nominate another team member to ensure their completion.</span></p><p><strong><span>Both teams must:</span></strong></p><ul>
<li><span>Make appropriate effort to organise the match.</span></li>
<li><span>Ensure attendance to the match.</span></li>
<li><span>Inform the other team of any mercenaries and post their usage in the match thread.</span></li>
<li><span>Inform administrators of any potential issues with the match, or of any disputes.</span></li>
<li><span>Submit or verify the final score within an hour of the match ending.</span></li>
</ul><p><strong><span>The home team must:</span></strong></p><ul>
<li><span>Organise the server.</span></li>
<li><span>Appropriately administrate the server during the match.</span></li>
</ul><h3 id="Score-Submission" data-id="Score-Submission"><span>Score Submission</span></h3><p><strong><span>Teams must clearly state both the winner and match score of each map</span></strong></p><p><span>Logs and booking name must also be linked. If a non-ozfortress server was used, a download link to the demos must be provided.</span></p><p><span>Example:</span><br>
<span>cp_granary_pro: 4-1 Jasmine Tea </span><a href="http://logs.tf/xxxxxx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>logs.tf/xxxxxx</span></a><br>
<span>cp_badlands: 4-2 no safeword </span><a href="http://logs.tf/xxxxxx" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>logs.tf/xxxxxx</span></a><br>
<span>Booked under name: Paulsen</span></p><h2 id="34-Mercenaries" data-id="34-Mercenaries"><span>3.4 Mercenaries</span></h2><p><span>A mercenary is an unrostered player that is used in lieu of an unavailable team member. To be valid, mercenaries must have an ozfortress Citadel account and not be under any exclusion penalties.</span></p><p><span>Only </span><strong><span>two</span></strong><span> mercenaries per team are allowed in each match at any moment in time. Teams are allowed to swap mercenaries during the match provided the other team approves the new mercenary. Each team is allowed to use mercenaries a maximum of </span><strong><span>four matches per season</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><span>Mercenaries may only be used at the </span><strong><span>discretion of the opposing team captain</span></strong><span>. There is no restriction on mercenary use if allowed by the opposing team captain. Do be aware that it is unlikely that opposing team captains will allow players of significantly larger skill to participate in the match and therefore reasonable requests are preferred.</span></p><p><span>Team captains do have the right to deny any mercenary, even if they are from a lower bracket. However, please do try to accommodate reasonable mercenary use, as you may find yourself in the same position. We recommend contacting an administrator if you are unsure of the skill level of the potential mercenary.</span></p><p><span>When mercenaries are being requested, teams have the option to request them on a specific class. This would then lock them to that class during that match (with the exception of reasonable offclasses). Teams can also request a mercenary without specifying a class, allowing the mercenary to change classes at will. It is important to note that unless mercenaries have been explicitly allowed on one class, they are allowed to play a class of their choosing.</span></p><p><span>Manipulating other teams into allowing mercenaries in an infractable offence (e.g. If you allow us to use </span><em><span>high Premier player</span></em><span> we will allow you to use </span><em><span>low Open player</span></em><span>).</span></p><p><span>ozfortress administrators will act as arbitrators in such a case of unreasonable mercenary denial, and may decide to overrule a team captain’s decision and allow a mercenary of a reasonable skill level.</span></p><p><span>If you require a mercenary for a playoff match you must contact your bracket’s League Administrator. Administrator discretion will be used on a case-by-case to judge whether use of a mercenary is necessary. Mercenary usage in playoffs is heavily discouraged and this option will only be allowed if it is deemed that there is no better option available.</span></p><p><span>Mercenary use must be clearly stated in the match thread where they are used. The information provided must include their SteamID and link to their ozfortress Citadel profile.</span></p><p><span>Use the </span><a href="https://verify.ozfortress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>ozfortress Roster Verification Tool</span></a><span> to quickly verify all players prior to a match. To use the verifier, simply insert the status output from console of the current match as well as the match link or ID. The tool will process your inputs and validate all players, displaying any inconsistencies with rosters.</span></p><h2 id="35-Map-Selection" data-id="35-Map-Selection"><span>3.5 Map Selection</span></h2><p><span>Regular season matches will use two pre-defined maps from the map pool.</span></p><p><span>Maps for playoff matches are selected by the captains of each team. This process can be performed before the match or in-game via chat, but must be documented on the match page.</span></p><p><span>The selection process for a nine map pool (BO3):</span></p><ol>
<li><span>The higher seeded or home team will either choose to ban first or defer.</span></li>
<li><span>The first team (determined by the result of step one) will ban a map.</span></li>
<li><span>The second team will ban a map.</span></li>
<li><span>The first team will ban a map.</span></li>
<li><span>The second team will ban a map.</span></li>
<li><span>The first team will select the first map from the remaining pool.</span></li>
<li><span>The second team will select the second map from the remaining pool.</span></li>
<li><span>The first team will select the tiebreaker map from the remaining maps.</span></li>
</ol><p><span>For the Premier Grand Final (BO5), the selection process varies as follows:</span></p><ol start="6">
<li><span>The first team will select the third map from the remaining pool.</span></li>
<li><span>The second team will select the fourth map from the remaining pool.</span></li>
<li><span>The first team will select the tiebreaker map from the remaining maps.</span></li>
