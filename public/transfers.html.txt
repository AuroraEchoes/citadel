Players will be allowed to make two transfers into any team per season. Captains may apply for a player’s transfer at <em>any time</em>, however be aware of the eligibility and team limit restrictions.</p><p>For applicants to be eligible to play in a particular round, the transfer application must be submitted by <strong>11:59PM Sydney time the Thursday of the round before</strong>.
